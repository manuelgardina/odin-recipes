    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>  
        <li>1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>  
        <li>2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together chicken broth, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, cornstarch, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat. Add red pepper, yellow pepper, red onion, snow peas, and green onion, and saute until vegetables are crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove vegetables to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Lower heat to medium-high and add remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Cook shrimp for 2 minutes, flipping over halfway through. Return vegetables to the wok. Stir sauce and pour over shrimp and vegetables; stir constantly until sauce comes to a simmer and thickens, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
